Readability,10,"There is no consistent style regarding variable naming, whitespace, and documentation. Documentation is overly sparse or overly excessive. Variable names do not indicate their usage. Global variables are used unnecessarily.",,The code exhibits good style in some places but not in others.,"The code is pleasant to look at. There is a consistent style regarding variable naming, whitespace, and documentation. Whitespace is used to divide the code into logical blocks which are appropriately commented. Variables are named to indicate their usage. Global variables are used only when necessary."
